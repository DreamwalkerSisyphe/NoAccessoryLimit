# NoAccessoryLimit

A mod for Webfishing that allows you to set or remove the limit on how many accessories can be equipped at once.

The mod is only required client side, and so any additional accessories equipped should show up fine for other players even if they don't also have the mod installed. Likewise, any additional accessories added using the mod should remain equipped even after the mod is removed, as long as you don't unequip them.

# Configuration

The accessory limit can be set inside the mod's config file. By default the value is set to -1, which allows for a virtually limitless amount of accessories to be equipped.

# Installation

1. Install [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave/)
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DreamwalkerSisyphe/NoAccessoryLimit/releases) of the mod
3. Extract to the `GDWeave/mods/` folder
